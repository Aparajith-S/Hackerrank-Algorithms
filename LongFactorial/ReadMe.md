# Introduction
 the code was developed for a challenge that was solved in hackerrank 
 https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/extra-long-factorials/problem

# Code
`BigInteger` class uses a `std::string` container to make a growing integer storage which is not limited by the conventional integer size of a maximum of 64 bits. 
It has the basic arithmetic functions of `+,/,*,-` overloaded to support these operations.

Using this a factorial is computed to complete the task.
